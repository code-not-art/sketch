# Sketch - Documentation

The Sketch library exports a the `Sketch` type, which represents the definition of a procedurally generated art algorithm. It includes the functions to execute the drawing on an HTML canvas, as well as the parameters that can be used by an artist to control and vary the output of the algorithm. In addition, this library exports React web components that are built to render a `Sketch` to a canvas, including a full web page layout that can be used for developing a new `Sketch` with hot-reloading in the browser.

The documentation here is split into two major sections:

1. [`Sketch` Type Definition](./sketch-type-definition.md) - definition of a generative art algorithm and the tools exposed to the developer in the sketch.
2. [React Component Library](./react-component-library.md) - for rendering a `Sketch` to a canvas in the browser, and exposing control panels for a sketch's parameters.
