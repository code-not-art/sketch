# Make Code Not Art
TypeScript first library for drawing on the HTML5 Canvas. This library provides a set of tools that are focused on creating procedural art in the browser, with a specific focus on pseudo-random generative algorithms.

To see this library in action, take a look at the [code-not-art/sketch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@code-not-art/sketch) repository which provides a framework for interactive development of art alogrithms in the browser.
